--- TABLE VALIDATIONS ---

All Tables:
- Check for the correct number of entries.
- Check for duplicates.

Joined Tables:
X Check for duplicates introduced by joining tables with different shapes.
X For a few random BCDs, show the shard and full slit rectangles plotted on top of WISE images. 
This plot can also show the photometry per shard from Judge1 and Judge2.
X Comparisons between judge1 and judge2 photometry.
X A few stoplight plots.

bcd_metadata:
- For a random sample, compare DB values with the values inside headers.
- Histograms of: CHNLNUM, MJD_OBS, RAMPTIME, OBJTYPE, AOT_TYPE.

bcd_wise_map:
- For a (large-ish) sample, are all computed slit corners inside of the WISE footprint?
- What is the distribution of distances between a slit FOV and the WISE footprint center?
What is the maximum of this distribution?

foreground_model:
- For a random sample, compare the database value to that of the file it is supposed to be from.
- Plot of the distribution of zodi and ISM values.

judge1:
- For a random sample, compare database values with on-the-fly WISE photometry extractions.
- Histogram of photometry values.

judge2: 
- For a random sample, compare database values with on-the-fly BCD spectrum extractions.
- Histogram of average spectral values and in the bins, separated by suborder.

shard_positions:
- Compare some database values with on-the-fly sky positions.

--- ZODI IMAGE VALIDATIONS ---

- Compare a few spectra extracted from zodi images with the saved spectrum files.
- Sine plots for the CVZ for all campaigns.

--- SUPERDARK VALIDATIONS ---

- For all RAMPTIMES and zodi bins, show the superdarks arranged next to each other (there aren't that many).
- For some random sample, show trimmed and zodi/superdark subtracted constituent BCDs.
- For some sample of the tailored superdarks, show the full slit spectra of the bounding 
superdarks with the spectrum of the tailored superdark hopefully sensibly in between based on its zodi.
